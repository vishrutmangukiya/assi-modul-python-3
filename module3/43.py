#The zip() method in Python is a very powerful and versatile function used for a variety of purposes. 

#1. Pairing Elements from Multiple Iterables
# The primary use of zip() is to combine elements from multiple iterables (like lists, tuples, etc.) into tuples, pairing elements based on their position. 
# This is particularly useful when you need to process two or more lists together.
