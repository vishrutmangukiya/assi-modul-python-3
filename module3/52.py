# # How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

# Built-in Functions:

# These are functions that are pre-defined in Python and are available for use without the need for explicit definition.
# Examples include print(), len(), max(), min(), type(), and many others.
# User-defined Functions:

# These are functions that users define based on their specific needs.
# Users can create their own functions using the def keyword and define the functionality within the function block.
# Example of a user-defined function:
# python
# Copy code
# def greet(name):
#     print("Hello, " + name + "!")
